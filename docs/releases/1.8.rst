====================================
FeinCMS 1.8 release notes (upcoming)
====================================

Welcome to FeinCMS 1.8!


Major feature 1
===============


Backwards-incompatible changes
==============================


Removal of deprecated features
------------------------------

* The old media library content type module
  :py:mod:`feincms.content.medialibrary.models` has been replaced with the
  contents of :py:mod:`feincms.content.medialibrary.v2`. The model field
  ``position`` has been renamed to ``type``, instead of ``POSITION_CHOICES``
  you should use ``TYPE_CHOICES`` now. The code has been simplified and
  hacks to imitate ``raw_id_fields`` have been replaced by working stock
  code. The ``v2`` module will stay around for another release and will be
  removed in FeinCMS v1.8. The now-unused template
  ``admin/content/mediafile/init.html`` has been deleted.


New deprecations
----------------

* ``Page.setup_request()`` does not do anything anymore and will be removed
  in FeinCMS v1.8.
