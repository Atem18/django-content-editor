Backwards-incompatible changes
==============================


Removal of deprecated features
------------------------------


New deprecations
================

* ``RSSContent`` and ``update_rsscontent`` have been deprecated, those being
  the only reason why ``FeinCMS`` depends on ``feedparser``. This will allow
  us to remove this dependency. Users should switch to
  `feincms-syndication <https://github.com/feincms/feincms-syndication>`_
  instead.

* The automatic discovery of subclasses of ``NavigationExtension`` has been
  replaced with an explicit mechanism of defining navigation extensions.

Compatibility with Django and other apps

against Django 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and the upcoming 1.7.
